Welcome To Empirium - By: Anthony Nadeau, David Ano-Trudeau, Theodore Tsimiklis, and George Athanasatos

In Empirium, you play as Bobius, a Warrior who has been captured by the Romans. The Roman King wishes to have you fight in the colliseum, to "test" your abilities.
In this roguelike style game, you must face off against waves of prisoners charging at you trying to end your life. At the end of every wave, you shall face one of the King's 
finest Champions. As the game gets progressively more difficult, use your points to upgrade your abilities, and try to stay alive.

For instructions on how to use the controls, please check out the "Instructions" page on the Main Menu.

Happy fighting, and GOOD LUCK









p.s. that bird seems suspicious.
